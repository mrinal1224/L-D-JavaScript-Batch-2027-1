# Hard JavaScript Interview Practice Sheet: 50 Full Detailed Problems

---

## Problem 1: Implement a Promise Pool (Concurrency Limiter)

### Interview Framing

You are given an array of async tasks. Each task is a function that returns a promise. Run at most `k` tasks at the same time and return all results in input order.

### Problem Statement

Implement `promisePool(tasks, limit)`.

* `tasks` is an array of functions, where each function returns a promise.
* `limit` is the maximum number of tasks that may run concurrently.
* Return a promise that resolves with an array of results in the same order as `tasks`.
* If any task rejects, the returned promise should reject immediately.

### Requirements

* Preserve input order.
* Never run more than `limit` tasks at once.
* Start the next task as soon as one finishes.
* Handle `limit <= 0` as invalid input.

### Function Signature

```js
function promisePool(tasks, limit) {}
```

### Example

```js
const tasks = [
  () => Promise.resolve(1),
  () => new Promise(r => setTimeout(() => r(2), 100)),
  () => Promise.resolve(3)
];
```

### Hints

* Track the next index to schedule.
* Track active task count.
* Resolve only when all tasks finish.

---

## Problem 2: Retry with Exponential Backoff

### Interview Framing

A flaky external API fails intermittently. Implement a retry helper with exponential backoff.

### Problem Statement

Implement `retryWithBackoff(fn, retries, delay)`.

* `fn` is a function returning a promise.
* Retry up to `retries` times after failures.
* Wait `delay`, then `delay * 2`, then `delay * 4`, and so on.
* Resolve as soon as one attempt succeeds.
* Reject with the last error if all attempts fail.

### Function Signature

```js
async function retryWithBackoff(fn, retries, delay) {}
```

### Requirements

* `retries` means additional attempts after the first try.
* Delay should grow exponentially.
* No retries after success.

### Hints

* Wrap each attempt in `try/catch`.
* Use a helper `wait(ms)`.

---

## Problem 3: Promise.all with Concurrency Control

### Interview Framing

You need `Promise.all`, but the system should not overwhelm downstream services.

### Problem Statement

Implement `limitedPromiseAll(taskFns, limit)`.

* `taskFns` is an array of functions returning promises.
* Return results in input order.
* Never run more than `limit` tasks at the same time.
* Reject immediately if any task fails.

### Difference from Problem 1

Frame this as a custom `Promise.all` with concurrency control and ask for production-grade handling of many tasks.

### Function Signature

```js
function limitedPromiseAll(taskFns, limit) {}
```

### Hints

* Similar scheduling logic to promise pool.
* Think of it as lazy promise creation.

---

## Problem 4: Event Loop Output Prediction #1

### Interview Framing

Predict the output and explain the ordering in terms of call stack, microtasks, and macrotasks.

### Problem Statement

Given:

```js
console.log('A');
setTimeout(() => console.log('B'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('C'));
console.log('D');
```

Answer:

1. What is the output?
2. Why?
3. What changes if the promise chain is nested?

### Requirements

* Explain the exact ordering.
* Mention when the microtask queue is drained.

---

## Problem 5: Implement async/await Using Generators

### Interview Framing

Build a tiny runner that executes generator functions yielding promises.

### Problem Statement

Implement `run(generatorFn)` so that code like async/await can be simulated with generators.

### Function Signature

```js
function run(generatorFn) {}
```

### Requirements

* Support `yield` of promises.
* Resume generator with resolved value.
* Propagate rejection into generator via `throw`.
* Return a promise for the final result.

### Hints

* Call `iterator.next(value)` and `iterator.throw(error)`.
* Recursively process yielded values.

---

## Problem 6: Sequential Async Task Queue

### Interview Framing

Create an object that accepts async tasks and ensures they run one at a time in insertion order.

### Problem Statement

Implement `createSequentialQueue()` returning an object with:

* `add(taskFn)`

Each added task starts only after the previous task settles.

### Requirements

* Preserve order.
* Continue queue even if one task fails.
* Each `add` returns a promise for that task’s result.

### Function Signature

```js
function createSequentialQueue() {}
```

### Hints

* Keep a tail promise.
* Chain the next task onto the previous one.

---

## Problem 7: Manual Promise Chaining

### Interview Framing

Implement a simplified promise-like structure supporting chained `then` calls.

### Problem Statement

Build a `MyPromise` with:

* constructor executor
* `then`
* `catch`
* basic chaining support

### Requirements

* `then` returns a new promise-like object.
* Returned values flow to next `then`.
* Thrown errors flow to rejection path.
* Support async executor settlement.

### Hints

* This is harder than storing one callback.
* Each `then` creates a new downstream promise.

---

## Problem 8: Promise Timeout Wrapper

### Interview Framing

Wrap a promise so it rejects if it takes too long.

### Problem Statement

### Function Signature

```js
function withTimeout(promise, ms) {}

### Hints

* Race original promise against timeout promise.
